        <p style="margin:0;font-size:0.9rem;">These Terms of Service apply to businesses and professional customers only. Our services are not directed at consumers. By using our services, you confirm that you are acting in the course of your business or profession.</p>
      </div>

      </ul>

      <h2>2. The Service</h2>
      <p>DLX provides an AI-powered receptionist service that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Answers inbound calls forwarded to a DLX phone number</li>
        <li>During business hours: rings the Client's phone first, then engages the AI if unanswered</li>
        <li>Outside business hours: engages the AI immediately</li>
        <li>Captures lead information from callers and delivers an SMS summary to the Client</li>
        <li>Stores call records in a secure database</li>
        <li>Answers basic frequently asked questions based on information provided by the Client</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.1 What the Service does not include</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Guaranteed availability (the Service is provided "as is" — see Section 7)</li>
        <li>Automated appointment booking</li>
        <li>Medical, legal, financial, or professional advice of any kind</li>
        <li>Emergency response services</li>
        <li>Collection of payment card details from callers</li>
        <li>Any outcome or result guarantee (revenue, lead quality, conversion)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Client Obligations</h2>
      <p>By using the Service, you agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate business information (hours, services, FAQs) and keep it updated</li>
        <li>Ensure callers are aware that calls may be recorded (our AI plays a recording disclaimer at the start of every call)</li>
        <li>Only use the Service for legitimate business purposes in compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy</li>
        <li>Not configure the Service to collect sensitive personal data (health, legal, financial, or payment card information) from callers</li>
        <li>Comply with all applicable laws, including data protection laws, in relation to your use of caller data delivered by DLX</li>
        <li>Not use the Service to make unsolicited calls (outbound robocalling or spam)</li>
        <li>Promptly notify DLX of any error, abuse, or security concern relating to the Service</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Pricing and Payment</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Plans</h3>
      <p>Clients may choose from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commission plan:</strong> no monthly fee, £10–£15 per qualified lead</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid plan:</strong> monthly base fee (£49–£99) plus £5–£10 per qualified lead</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Plan details are confirmed at onboarding. DLX reserves the right to change pricing with 30 days' written notice to existing clients.</p>

      <h3>4.2 Usage charges</h3>
      <p>Telephony usage charges (call minutes, SMS) are passed through at cost from DLX's telephony provider (Twilio). These are itemised on monthly invoices. If Twilio changes its pricing, we will notify clients in advance and invoices will reflect the updated rates from the effective date of the change.</p>

      <h3>4.3 Payment terms</h3>
      <p>Invoices are issued monthly in arrears. Payment is due within 14 days of invoice date. Late payments may incur statutory interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.</p>

      <h3>4.4 VAT</h3>
      <p>DLX SOLUTIONS GROUP LIMITED is not currently VAT registered. All prices are quoted exclusive of VAT. If DLX becomes VAT registered, VAT will be added at the prevailing rate and clients will be given 30 days' notice.</p>

      <h2>5. Qualified Leads</h2>
      <p>A "qualified lead" for billing purposes is a completed call interaction where all four of the following were captured:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Caller's name</li>
        <li>Caller's callback phone number (validated as a plausible UK number)</li>
        <li>Reason for calling</li>
        <li>Preferred callback time or urgency indication</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Duplicate calls from the same number within 48 hours are not billed as separate leads unless the reason for calling is materially different.</p>

      <h3>5.1 Disputes</h3>
      <p>If you believe a lead has been incorrectly charged, notify DLX within 14 days of receiving the invoice. DLX will investigate using call records and, where available, recordings. Disputes are resolved within 5 working days. Call recordings are available for verification within the 60-day retention window.</p>

      <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>All software, systems, AI models, and infrastructure used to provide the Service remain the property of DLX and its licensors. Nothing in this Agreement transfers intellectual property rights to the Client.</p>
      <p>Lead data and call records belong to the Client (as the data controller) subject to DLX's rights to hold and process such data in accordance with the Privacy Policy and any Data Processing Addendum.</p>

      <h2>7. Service Availability and Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>The Service is provided on a commercially reasonable efforts basis. DLX does not guarantee:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>100% uptime or uninterrupted availability</li>
        <li>That all calls will be answered or captured successfully</li>
        <li>That the AI will understand every caller or provide a perfect response</li>
        <li>Any specific business outcome, lead quality, or revenue increase</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Planned and emergency maintenance may affect Service availability. DLX will endeavour to give notice of planned downtime where practicable.</p>
      <p>The AI is designed to advise callers in apparent medical or safety emergencies to contact 999 or 112. DLX does not guarantee this will occur in every instance. <strong>The Service must not be configured or advertised as an emergency response service.</strong></p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DLX's total liability to the Client under or in connection with this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed the total fees paid by the Client to DLX in the <strong>three months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim</strong></li>
        <li>DLX shall not be liable for any indirect, consequential, special, or incidental loss, including loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss of business, or loss of data</li>
        <li>DLX shall not be liable for any failure to capture a call or lead, for AI errors, for telephony provider outages, or for missed business opportunities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nothing in these Terms limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or any other matter that cannot be excluded by law.</p>

      <h2>9. Data Protection</h2>
      <p>DLX processes personal data as a data processor on behalf of the Client (who is the data controller) in relation to caller data. DLX processes its own client data as a data controller. Full details are in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
      <p>Clients who require a formal Data Processing Addendum (DPA) for GDPR compliance should contact DLX to request one.</p>

      <h2>10. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>Each party agrees to keep confidential any non-public information of the other party received in connection with this Agreement, and not to disclose such information to third parties without prior written consent, except as required by law.</p>

      <h2>11. Term and Termination</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commission plan:</strong> either party may terminate with 7 days' written notice</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid plan:</strong> either party may terminate with 30 days' written notice</li>
        <li>DLX may suspend or terminate the Service immediately if the Client breaches the Acceptable Use Policy, fails to pay outstanding amounts after a 7-day cure notice, or engages in conduct that exposes DLX to legal risk</li>
        <li>Upon termination, any outstanding invoices become immediately due and payable</li>
        <li>DLX will delete Client lead data within 30 days of termination, subject to legal retention requirements</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>DLX may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated to existing clients by email with 30 days' notice. Continued use of the Service after the notice period constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

      <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>This Agreement and any dispute arising from it shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales. Both parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>

      <h2>14. Entire Agreement</h2>
      <p>These Terms, together with any service order or onboarding confirmation and any Data Processing Addendum, constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede all prior representations, agreements, and understandings.</p>
